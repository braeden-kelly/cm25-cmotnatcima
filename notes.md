- Why use microservices
  - Scalability 
  - Cost reasons (scale down to zero)
  - Deploying Independently
- What is .net aspire
  - Two main parts
    - App host
      - Startup project for app that knows about all the microservices and can start them all up for you
    - Service default
- Don't deal with ports, just define project endpoint 
  - Can easily implement http fallback
- Can deploy outside .net aspire
  - Specify ports in a config
- Can add containers in .net code instead of having to do this outside of the application
- Benefits for monoliths as well 
- Resiliency
  - AddStandardResilienceHandler
  - Health checks
    - Health/live
- Observability
  - Open Telemetry
    - There's a serilog sink for this
- Modularity
- Azure container apps
  - Can scale to absolute zero
